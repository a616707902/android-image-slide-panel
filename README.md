image as a card, which can be slided to the left or the right and fade away<br>

To highlight my English skills, i decide to create the README.md file in English this time. Here should arise some applause. -_-<br>

####source intention
There exists a Chinese app "初页" which enables users to customize their gorgeous html5 pages, which is really cool. I was totally shocked at the first sight of those various splendid H5 visual effects. <br>
Recently, as i was not busy at my work time, i decide to implement one of those fantastic effects in native android language. However, while i was able to control every details when sliding the image which is on the screen, i added some new features to this demo, and maybe you will like it more. 
####features
* only the foremost image could be slided to the horizontal side of the screen and fade away.
* the image which was faded away is restored at the bottom of the view stack.
* all the images could be reborn without creating a new view.<br>
