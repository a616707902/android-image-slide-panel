There exists a Chinese app "初页" which enables users to customize their gorgeous html5 pages, which is really cool. I was totally shocked at the first sight of those various splendid H5 visual effects. <br>
Recently, as i was not busy at my work time, i decide to implement one of those fantastic effects in native android language. However, while you control every details when sliding the screen, i added some new features to this demo.
